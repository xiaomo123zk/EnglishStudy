(1)Contractions refer to two words combined in casual contexts (e.g., “It’s”, “I’d”, and “can’t”). Avoid these in academic writing (use “It is,” “I would,” and “cannot”, respectively).

(2)Tip: Compound adjectives are usually hyphenated, unless the first part of the compound is an adverb ending in “ly.”  Remove the hyphen in these cases.

(5)Please, check whether the proposed phrasing conveys the intended message. The original phrasing was slightly confusing.
   original:"if the algorithm backtracks to the root link (first link) and no color can be chosen for it, it indicates that the needed color count C cannot color all links"
   modified:"If the algorithm backtracks to the root link (first link) and no color can be seleted, the number of color C is not sufficient to color all links. "
